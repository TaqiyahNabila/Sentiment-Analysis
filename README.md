## üîç Problem Statement

> Many users of the Pos Indonesia app leave reviews expressing frustration or satisfaction. However, without automated analysis, it‚Äôs hard to extract useful patterns. This project aims to:
>
> * Classify sentiment in reviews using rule-based NLP (NLTK VADER)
> * Visualize trends in user feedback
> * Focus on **negative sentiment** to provide data-driven recommendations

## üìä Data Collection

* **Source**: Google Play Store reviews
* **Method**: Web scraping
* **Dataset size**: \~1000 reviews
* **Columns**:

  * `Review Text`
  * `Rating`
  * `Timestamp`
  * `Sentiment Label` (based on rating and/or VADER score)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1. **Text Preprocessing**

   * Lowercasing, punctuation removal
   * Tokenization
   * Stopword removal

2. **Sentiment Scoring**

   * Used **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to compute compound score
   * Rules:

     * Compound ‚â• 0.05 ‚Üí Positive
     * -0.05 < Compound < 0.05 ‚Üí Neutral
     * Compound ‚â§ -0.05 ‚Üí Negative

3. **Visualization**

   * Bar chart: Sentiment distribution
   * Line plot: Sentiment trend over time
   * WordCloud: Most frequent words in each sentiment category

## üìä Results

* **Sentiment Distribution**:

  * Positive: 4.6%
  * Neutral: 87.6%
  * Negative: 8.0%

* **Key Insights from Negative Comments**:

  * Tracking delays
  * Slow delivery
  * Poor customer service

---

## üí° Recommendations

* Improve customer support responsiveness
* Fix bugs related to tracking and refund visibility
* Enhance app UI to show real-time delivery status
